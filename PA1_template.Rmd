## Loading and preprocessing the data
data <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
steps_by_date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
hist(steps_by_date$steps, xlab="Steps", main="Steps by Date")
mean(steps_by_date$steps)
median(steps_by_date$steps)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

avg_steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)
plot(avg_steps_by_interval, type='l')
avg_steps_by_interval[which.max(avg_steps_by_interval$steps),]$interval

## Imputing missing values
sum(is.na(data$steps))
library(plyr)
data_imputed <- ddply(data, 
      .(interval), 
      transform, 
      steps=ifelse(is.na(steps), median(steps, na.rm=TRUE), steps))
      
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
